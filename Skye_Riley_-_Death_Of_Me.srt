Intro
(by Fontanari, C.)

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,500
Left your kisses in the car,

3
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,350
I'm just sittin' in it

4
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:14,450
Found your jacket at the bar,

5
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:16,550
now I'm sleepin' in it

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,350
I'm a sucker for your heart,

7
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,250
took a bite out of it

8
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,250
Yeah, I can't resist it,

9
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:23,850
so-so-so delicious

10
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:27,450
Can't back out, yeah, you've done it now

11
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:30,550
Hold me in your arms tonight

12
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:33,350
Until it's hard to see,

13
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:35,450
till I cannot breathe

14
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:38,650
Tell me what to sacrifice

15
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:43,450
'Cause you're a killer,
going in for the kill, yeah

16
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:46,350
I'm not scared to go,

17
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,450
I'm collateral

18
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:49,550
Knocked out,

19
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,250
your love will be the death of me

20
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,350
Not scared to go,

21
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:56,350
it's not rational

22
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:57,650
Strung out,

23
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:59,850
I'll trade it for my sanity

24
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:01,750
I don't wanna give you up,

25
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:04,050
I don't wanna give you up (I can't)

26
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:05,450
I don't wanna give you up,

27

I don't wanna give you up (I can't)

28
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:12,450
I'm not scared to go, I'm collateral

29
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,500
Knocked out, love will be the death of me

30
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:20,500
You can have me a
la carte, no condition to it

31
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:24,350
I'm the target throw a dart,
yeah, just stick it to it

32
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:28,200
Took a step into noir,
you're a villain with it

33
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:32,100
Yeah, mm, guess I'm complicit

34
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,600
Can't back out, yeah, you've done it now
