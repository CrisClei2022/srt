1
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,500
Twisted all my limbs for you

2
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:16,650
Two of them in knots, and
two of them in loops

3
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,900
Ribbons tied around like a noose

4
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,800
Wonder if I'll ever get it loose

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,600
I don't wanna bruise for you

6
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,900
Holding back my words until
my face is blue

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,900
I don't really care about your crew

8
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,900
You can tell 'em what you wanted to

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,200
Pushin' me

10
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,300
Lovin' me

11
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,300
Pullin' me

12
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,300
Fuckin' me

13
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,500
Crushin' me

14
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,900
Touchin' me...

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm done, I'm done

16
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,650
Done doing backbends, I break

17
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:08,150
And I snap, it's
no fun, no fun

18
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:14,500
Pushed myself into a box,
while you held out a gun

19
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:21,400
I'm done,

20
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:28,500
I'm done, I'm done,

21
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:32,000
Twisting all my bones like screws

22
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:36,250
Stretching my self worth,
just like you usually do

23
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,400
Caught you like the cold
or a flu

24
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,000
Praying that I'll someday be immune

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,700
Got me like a bad tattoo

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,200
Always under skin, even when
it gets removed

27
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:56,750
Never got a chance to undo

28
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:00,700
Positions that you forced
my way into

29
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,300
Pushin' me

30
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,250
Lovin' me

31
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,300
Pullin' me

32
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,400
Fuckin' me

33
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,500
Crushin' me

34
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,700
Touchin' me...

35
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:20,700
I'm done, I'm done

36
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:24,450
Done doing backbends
I break and I snap,

37
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,200
It's
no fun, no fun

38
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:34,200
Pushed myself into a box,
while you held out a gun

39
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:40,550
I'm done

40
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:47,950
I'm done, I'm done,

41
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,100
Pushin' me

42
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,300
Lovin' me

43
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,100
Pullin' me

44
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,200
Fuckin' me

45
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,100
Crushin' me

46
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,100
Touchin' me
